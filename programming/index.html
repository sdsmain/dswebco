                    <h2>My Current Experiences</h2>
                    <h3>Assembly (x86 / x64)</h3>
                    <p>I have started learning a little bit about assembly language towards the end of 2024. I would like to continue to find videos and other material relating to assembly so that I can learn more and hopefully get into Assembly for other types of processors</p>
                    <h3>C</h3>
                    <p>This is one language that I would like to learn the most since there are already a few projects I can use C for.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Playstation Homebrew</li>
                            <li>Nintendo Wii Homebrew</li>
                            <Li>Gameboy Homebrew</Li>
                            <li>Linux</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h3>C++</h3>
                    <p>I messed around with C++ during my early years of beginning programming. I always wanted to use C more for some reason at that time. I would like to find some projects to do in C++.</p>
                    <h3>C#</h3>
                    <p>This was the language I used for the majority of my career at one of my former jobs. I used this in conjunction with ASP.Net to create a CRUD form for the company. It's fun to mess with and may find a time to revisit this language again.</p>
                    <h3>Javascript</h3>
                    <p>My knowledge in Javascript is basic. If I am going to get into web development, I would like to be more proficient with the language.</p>
                    <h3>Python</h3>
                    <p>I find this language to be fun. I have used to mess with files as well as a few other operations that seem fast to write in Python. </p>

                    <h3>C</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Effective C -- I am still trying to get used to pointers. I don't know why they confuse me sometimes.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Python</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Inventing Your Own Computer Games With Python --  Really fun book to read so far. Love the exercises and example games.</li>
